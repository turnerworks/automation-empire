## 📝 Presentation Overview

The presentation consists of 6 slides:

### Slide 1: One-page opener for Dad
- What I'm building
- Why I want this
- How it starts

### Slide 2: NO
A bold rejection of the surface-level pitch, leading into the real story.

### Slide 3: The Real Story
Reframes the entire narrative from a third-party perspective looking in on the relationship between father and son.

### Slide 4: Laurence, 36
- Studied business at university to bring home the skills his father needed
- His dad was a businessman with an Eastern background—entrepreneurship was in the DNA
- They bonded over stories, ideas, and visions of what they'd build together (2008–2016)
- Life happened. Turmoil, setbacks, ups and downs
- The dream never launched

### Slide 5: The Father, 70
- A businessman, now retired
- Introverted by nature, but sparked something in his son
- Shared stories and dreams that lit up the years between 2008 and 2016
- The joint venture never materialized
- Now 70, watching from a distance as life moves forward

### Slide 6: What This Is Really About
Laurence wants to show his father:
- The skills and values you gave me are alive in how I build today
- The stories we bonded over (2008–2016) weren't wasted—they shaped my vision
- Technology has evolved to where what we dreamed about is now possible through automation and AI
- Even though we never built it together, I'm building it now—and you can watch the empire grow in real time
- This is the business we talked about, just through a different lens
